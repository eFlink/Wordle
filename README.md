# Wordle

This was my first Time using C and I learn't so much and had so much fun shooting myself in the foot while also gaining a deeper appreciation of programming in general.

Due to a reliance on libraries provided for by the university, I haven't been able to get this working locally. I plan on coming back to make the function myself so that it does work.
